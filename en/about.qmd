Beyond wholesale distribution, Bizzup Depot has embraced innovation through a strategic partnership with Ploma LLC to offer direct-to-consumer grocery delivery, and recently launched its own restaurant in Oakland, expanding its reach from kitchens to dining tables. Partnering with 200+ restaurants and 30+ markets, the company continues to build strong relationships and deliver authentic flavors that enrich the culinary landscape of Northern California.
